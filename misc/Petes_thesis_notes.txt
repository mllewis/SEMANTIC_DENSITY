NOTES ON PETE'S THESIS
- compare documents containing the same "information content"
	*  Bible (214 languages from 29 language families)
	*  New Testament (828 languages from 87 language families)
	* European Parliamentary Proceedings from 1996 through 2011 (21 languages from 2 language families) 
- measure information density using Huffman encoding - fewer bits, each bit contains more conceptual info (denser lang)
- average across documewnts
- normalize by english
- information density measure corrrelated across documents
- Information density -> higher mean distance in space, lower variability
- also looked and speech rate:
	* strong negative association between the information density rate and the speech information transfer rate:  informationally denser languages will tend toward faster speech information transfer rates due to their increased encoding efficiency.


IN SUM: 
* there is significant variation in languages rate of lexical information density
* rate of information density is positively associated with the density the conceptual space 
* rate of information density  negatively associated with the speech information transfer rate. 

Three variables:
	* Information density - Huffman encoding (encoding in speech)
	* Conceptual density - mean distance in conceptual space (embedding models)
	* speech information transfer rate.
